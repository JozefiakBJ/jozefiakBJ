## ‚ö° About me

Here are some of the skills I have acquired during my learning journey:

In my daily routine, I extensively use SQL and data modeling. During my free time, I enjoy expanding my knowledge in Flutter and Mobile development.

I'm currently fascinated by Mobile development with Flutter, and you can find one of my projects here: https://github.com/JozefiakBJ/demo_type

I'm committed to writing clean code and constantly improving my skills and knowledge.

Some time ago, I worked on projects in JAVA and also gained experience with Spring and database usage. Some of my notable projects include:

:atm: https://github.com/jozefiakBJ/JavaATM-SQL  - Pure JavaSE atm simulator

:atm: https://github.com/jozefiakBJ/exchange  - Spring Boot rest api Currency exchange
